# Getting Started

## About

A basic authentication starter-kit built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/master), [Intertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) components, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This starter kit aims to provide similar functionality as the official [Laravel + Vue Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/vue-starter-kit), but utilizing **PrimeVue** components instead of **Shadcn for Vue**.

This starter kit provides a simple implementation of all of Laravel's [authentication features](https://laravel.com/docs/master/authentication), including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation.

-   Create a new repository using the [public template on GitHub](https://github.com/new?template_name=laravel-primevue-starter-kit&template_owner=connorabbas).
