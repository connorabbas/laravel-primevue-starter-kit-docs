# Introduction

## About

An opinionated authentication starter-kit for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/master), built with [Intertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (with TypeScript), [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) components, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This starter kit aims to provide similar functionality as the official [Laravel + Vue Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/vue-starter-kit), but utilizing **PrimeVue** components instead of **Shadcn for Vue**.

This starter kit provides a simple implementation of all of Laravel's [authentication features](https://laravel.com/docs/master/authentication), including: login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation. There is also a User profile page, where authenticated Users can update their information (name, email, password), or delete their account if desired.

To view the starter kit in action, you can visit the [demo site](https://demo.laravel-primevue-starter-kit.com).
